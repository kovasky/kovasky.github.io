      <description>Intro After tirelessly looking for a solution in order to dynamically create a whitelist for Suricata based on DNS, I decided to create my own.
Download the necessary files Create a whitelist file with all the domains you wish whitelisted. A useful starting point is anudeepND&amp;rsquo;s collection of commonly white listed domains. After that, download my generateRules.py script.
Place these files in a directory of your choice on your PfSense host.</description>

      <title>Automatically create local home directory when logging in with FreeIPA</title>

      <description>Intro While setting up my hosts with FreeIPA, I noticed that home directories were not being created when logging in through ssh. Looking online it seems that most people just use NFS shares to keep home directories the same across devices but I did not want to set up NFS home shares. Fixing this in RHEL-based distros is easy with authconfig but debian-based distros do not come with this. To fix this in debian-based distros is as easy as modiyfing the pam.</description>

      <title>NTP server with GPS and chrony</title>

      <description>Intro I wanted to easily synchronize the time between my VMs and decided to set up an ntp server to accomplish this. Since a USB GPS device is relatively inexpensive, I thought it would be a great addition to the project.
For the following examples, I used aptitude and vim.
Prerequisite Packages Run the following command to ensure we have the necessary packages:
sudo apt-get update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients chrony Check /dev for GPS Once the gps is connected to the pc, we need to figure out the assigned device.</description>
