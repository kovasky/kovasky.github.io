&lt;p>In the search for an open-source Google Analytics alternative, two options stood out Matomo and Plausible. I wanted the tool to be privacy-friendly and that it did not require cookies, avoiding those pesky consent prompts. I did not find a straightforward guide to self-host Plausible with a Google Search Console integration which led me to create this post.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ensure that your domain&amp;rsquo;s ownership is confirmed in the Google Search Console. To do this, take a look at Google&amp;rsquo;s guide &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34592?hl=en">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Set up Outline Wiki with local object storage and OIDC integration</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/get_outline/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/get_outline/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I started using Notion&amp;rsquo;s free tier as a knowledge bank for a side project. It&amp;rsquo;s measley 1000 blocks were capped quickly and searching for an alternative lead to Outline. Outline is 100% free, selfhostable, and has a very similar featureset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the guides out there configure Outline with an S3 store for object storage, but I do not really have a need for it. Also, I wanted to integrate Outline with Authelia for integration with my Active Directory server as well as Fail2Ban.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Fail2Ban with Cloudflare on a free account</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/cloudflare_fail2ban/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/cloudflare_fail2ban/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To better protect my web accessible services, I decided to use Fail2Ban in conjunction with Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s WAF to block IPs with more than 3 failed login attempts. I already leverage Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s CDN and geo-blocking capabilities on my homelab, so I opted to utilize their WAF to block access to potential attackers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the free tier, the WAF is limited to 5 rules, which can easily reach their limit. A workaround is to create a rule that uses a blocklist and then with the Lists API, update it as required.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
