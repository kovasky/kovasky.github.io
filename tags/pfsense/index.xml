This usually happened when my ISP renewed my assigned IP overnight. The only solution was to reboot my pfSense VM to force the IP lease renewal. Searching the web I discovered it was not uncommon for people to experience this with certain types of modems and virtualized pfSense instances. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I resolved it in my homelab.</description></item><item><title>Set up multiple domains on one public IP using HAProxy on pfSense</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/haproxy_multi_domain/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/haproxy_multi_domain/</guid><description>Intro I recently acquired a second domain for one of my projects and wanted to set this up behind the HAProxy instance in my firewall. The problem was that I was already serving my primary domain with it, so I was looking to serve my secondary one as well. It was not as straightforward as I thought but after a bit of Googling and some trial and error, I could proxy multiple domains sharing the same public IP.</description></item><item><title>Homelab</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/homelab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/homelab/</guid><description>Intro This is just a post to describe my homelab setup and make it linkable where needed (like in my resume). This is most definitely subject to change at any time as I continue to play with new technologies and keep adding things!
Hosts My homelab consists of a one node proxmox host and a terramaster NAS.
The specs are:
Dell Poweredge T440 2x Xeon Gold 6126 (48 logical cores) 128GB RAM 1x 118GB Intel Optane NVME 2x 1TB MX500 SSD 2x 8TB Toshiba SAS Drive 1x 14TB IronWolf Pro Drive 1x Nvidia Quadro M2000 For storage I have a TerraMaster F2-220 running DSM through tinycore with 2x 6TB Ironwolf HDDs.</description></item><item><title>Whitelisting in Suricata Package for pfSense</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/whitelist/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/whitelist/</guid><description>Intro After tirelessly looking for a solution in order to dynamically create a whitelist for Suricata based on DNS, I decided to create my own.
Download the necessary files Create a whitelist file with all the domains you wish whitelisted. A useful starting point is anudeepND&amp;rsquo;s collection of commonly white listed domains. After that, download my generateRules.py script.
Place these files in a directory of your choice on your pfSense host.</description></item></channel></rss>
