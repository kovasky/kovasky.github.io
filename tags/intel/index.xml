&lt;p>I took a leap of faith by buying an Intel Alchemist series GPU, even after countless people online advised against purchasing one if the target system doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Resizable BAR. Still, AV1 at this price point felt too compelling to pass up, even if it meant subpar graphical performance. My main intent was transcoding media, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect much, but the Intel Arc A380 performed surprisingly well for my needs, showing results close to a GTX 1650. Best of all, converting my media to AV1 has already saved over 9TB of storage space (more than a 50% reduction in space usage).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enabling SR-IOV for an Intel X540-T2 on Proxmox 8</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/sr_iov/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/sr_iov/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the quest to get more performance out of my inter-vm communication, I stumbled upon SR-IOV and virtual functions. I then purchased a 10gbe X540-T2 from a Chinese seller on eBay making sure to get one with a fan, as reports of this specific card say it runs quite hot. After setting everything up, I increased my network performance from 2.5gbps on a vSwitch to 14gbps with virtual function passthrough.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
