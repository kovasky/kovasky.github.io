I like having access to all the SMART data in my drives in one single spot, so I decided to include my NAS&amp;rsquo; drives as well. This is how I did it.
Pre-requisites Scrutiny depends on smartctl v7+ which, unfortunately, my NAS did not have. To check the version of smartctl that your NAS has installed, SSH into it and issue the command /usr/bin/smartctl -i.</description></item></channel></rss>
