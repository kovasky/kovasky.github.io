      <description>Intro After creating my domain trust between AD and FreeIPA, I was left wanting to access restricted resources in Linux using my AD accounts. To circumvent this, I mapped a group from AD to FreeIPA and gave it the appropriate permissions.
Create the group in AD The first step would be to create a group in AD to which sudo will be mapped. In my case, I created a group named &amp;lsquo;sudo&amp;rsquo; to match the Linux counterpart.</description>

      <description>Intro After creating a trust in FreeIPA, I kept having to write the full domain alongside my username whenever I tried to access the system. These are the steps I took to log in only with my username.
Editing SSSD.conf Navigate to /etc/sssd/ and open sssd.conf in an elevated text editor. It should look something like
[domain/lin.mydomain.com] ... [sssd] services = nss, pam, ssh, sudo domains = lin.mydomain.com Under [sssd], modify the domains line and add your ad domain.</description>

      <title>Setting up a cross-domain trust between FreeIPA and AD</title>

      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with FreeIPA in my homelab for a while and have always wanted to enable seamless authentication between all my hosts regardless of their operating system. I stumbled upon the concept of cross-domain trusts between FreeIPA and Active Directory which allows us to achieve this.
There is a caveat though, and that is that two-way trusts are still not fully implemented in FreeIPA, which means Windows users can authenticate against Linux hosts but Linux users can&amp;rsquo;t do the same the other way around.</description>
