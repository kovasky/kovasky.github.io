&lt;p&gt;I was tired of entering my password every time I SSH&amp;rsquo;d to my VMs, but setting up SSH keys would mean manually copying my public key to each host I wanted to connect to. I then read about one key feature of FreeIPA, which is serving as a centralized key repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This posed another problem: I don’t have any users in FreeIPA, as I mainly use my AD credentials (FreeIPA is one way only, and many services interact directly with Active Directory). Here’s how I generated and stored my AD user’s public key in FreeIPA, which allows me to remote into any enrolled device without manually distributing the keys.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Setting up a cross-domain trust between FreeIPA and AD</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/ad_trust/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/ad_trust/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with FreeIPA in my homelab for a while and have always wanted to enable seamless authentication between all my hosts regardless of their operating system. I stumbled upon the concept of cross-domain trusts between FreeIPA and Active Directory which allows us to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a caveat though, and that is that two-way trusts are still not fully implemented in FreeIPA, which means Windows users can authenticate against Linux hosts but Linux users can&amp;rsquo;t do the same the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
