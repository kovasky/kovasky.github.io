      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with FreeIPA in my homelab for a while and have always wanted to enable seamless authentication between all my hosts regardless of their operating system. I stumbled upon the concept of cross-domain trusts between FreeIPA and Active Directory which allows us to achieve this.
There is a caveat though, and that is that two-way trusts are still not fully implemented in FreeIPA, which means Windows users can authenticate against Linux hosts but Linux users can&amp;rsquo;t do the same the other way around.</description>
