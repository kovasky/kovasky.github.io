I then purchased a 10gbe X540-T2 from a Chinese seller on eBay making sure to get one with a fan, as reports of this specific card say it runs quite hot. After setting everything up, I increased my network performance from 2.5gbps on a vSwitch to 14gbps with virtual function passthrough.</description></item><item><title>Disk passthrough for vms in Proxmox</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/disk_passthrough/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/disk_passthrough/</guid><description>Intro It has always been recommended to give ZFS full disk control, so after placing my raid card in HBA mode, I went ahead and gave full disk control to my TrueNAS vm.
