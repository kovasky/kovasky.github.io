&lt;p>I recently acquired a Dell Poweredge T440, and after installing a GPU the fans skyrocketed. This turned the server into a noise machine. To solve this, I created a script that disables third-party PCI mode and based on a threshold, set the fan speed to 20% or to be controlled by Dell&amp;rsquo;s fan profile. These are the steps I took to make my T440 silent again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="downgrading-idrac-9-firmware-to-3303030">Downgrading iDRAC 9 firmware to 3.30.30.30&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For this whole setup to work, iDRAC needs to be on firmware 3.30.30.30, as later firmware revisions remove the ability to control the fan speed. The firmware can be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us">Dell&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a>. To downgrade, navigate to your iDRAC&amp;rsquo;s web admin page, and under Maintenance-&amp;gt;System Update you can apply the downgrade. After the downgrade, make sure IPMI over LAN is enabled under iDRAC Settings-&amp;gt;Connectivity-&amp;gt;Network-&amp;gt;IPMI Settings.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
