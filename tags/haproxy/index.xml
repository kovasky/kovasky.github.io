&lt;p&gt;Some of my hosted services do not have OIDC support or any sort of authentication out of the box. Since I am already running an instance of Authelia, I decided to use it to secure those services. It was not as straight forward as I thought, specially using HAProxy on pfSense. There are a few outdated guides that accomplish this but they still missed a step or two to get it working right.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Set up multiple domains on one public IP using HAProxy on pfSense</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/haproxy_multi_domain/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/haproxy_multi_domain/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently acquired a second domain for one of my projects and wanted to set this up behind the HAProxy instance in my firewall. The problem was that I was already serving my primary domain with it, so I was looking to serve my secondary one as well. It was not as straightforward as I thought but after a bit of Googling and some trial and error, I could proxy multiple domains sharing the same public IP. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
