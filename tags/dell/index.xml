&lt;p&gt;I took a leap of faith by buying an Intel Alchemist series GPU, even after countless people online advised against purchasing one if the target system doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Resizable BAR. Still, AV1 at this price point felt too compelling to pass up, even if it meant subpar graphical performance. My main intent was transcoding media, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect much, but the Intel Arc A380 performed surprisingly well for my needs, showing results close to a GTX 1650. Best of all, converting my media to AV1 has already saved over 9TB of storage space (more than a 50% reduction in space usage).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Enabling SR-IOV for an Intel X540-T2 on Proxmox 8</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/sr_iov/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/sr_iov/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quest to get more performance out of my inter-vm communication, I stumbled upon SR-IOV and virtual functions. I then purchased a 10gbe X540-T2 from a Chinese seller on eBay making sure to get one with a fan, as reports of this specific card say it runs quite hot. After setting everything up, I increased my network performance from 2.5gbps on a vSwitch to 14gbps with virtual function passthrough.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>iDRAC 9 manual fan control on Dell PowerEdge servers</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/fan_control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/fan_control/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro"&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently acquired a Dell Poweredge T440, and after installing a GPU the fans skyrocketed. This turned the server into a noise machine. To solve this, I created a script that disables third-party PCI mode and based on a threshold, set the fan speed to 20% or to be controlled by Dell&amp;rsquo;s fan profile. These are the steps I took to make my T440 silent again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="downgrading-idrac-9-firmware-to-3303030"&gt;Downgrading iDRAC 9 firmware to 3.30.30.30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this whole setup to work, iDRAC needs to be on firmware 3.30.30.30, as later firmware revisions remove the ability to control the fan speed. The firmware can be downloaded from &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us"&gt;Dell&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;. To downgrade, navigate to your iDRAC&amp;rsquo;s web admin page, and under Maintenance-&amp;gt;System Update you can apply the downgrade. After the downgrade, make sure IPMI over LAN is enabled under iDRAC Settings-&amp;gt;Connectivity-&amp;gt;Network-&amp;gt;IPMI Settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
