&lt;p&gt;I took a leap of faith by buying an Intel Alchemist series GPU, even after countless people online advised against purchasing one if the target system doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Resizable BAR. Still, AV1 at this price point felt too compelling to pass up, even if it meant subpar graphical performance. My main intent was transcoding media, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I would mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect much, but the Intel Arc A380 performed surprisingly well for my needs, showing results close to a GTX 1650. Best of all, converting my media to AV1 has already saved over 9TB of storage space (more than a 50% reduction in space usage).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
