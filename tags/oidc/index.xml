&lt;p>Enabling SSO for all self-hosted services that support it has been one of the best decisions in my homelab. It has created a seamless &amp;ldquo;ecosystem&amp;rdquo; experience for my friends and family (mainly myself ðŸ¥²). The problem is that every time I logged in to my services, it prompted me with a consent form which I quickly grew tired of. To remove this consent page in all my connected OIDC clients, I enabled implicit consent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Set up Outline Wiki with local object storage and OIDC integration</title><link>https://kovasky.me/blogs/get_outline/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kovasky.me/blogs/get_outline/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I started using Notion&amp;rsquo;s free tier as a knowledge bank for a side project. It&amp;rsquo;s measley 1000 blocks were capped quickly and searching for an alternative lead to Outline. Outline is 100% free, selfhostable, and has a very similar featureset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the guides out there configure Outline with an S3 store for object storage, but I do not really have a need for it. Also, I wanted to integrate Outline with Authelia for integration with my Active Directory server as well as Fail2Ban.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
