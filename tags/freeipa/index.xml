      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with FreeIPA in my homelab for a while and have always wanted to enable seamless authentication between all my hosts regardless of their operating system. I stumbled upon the concept of cross-domain trusts between FreeIPA and Active Directory which allows us to achieve this.
There is a caveat though, and that is that two-way trusts are still not fully implemented in FreeIPA, which means Windows users can authenticate against Linux hosts but Linux users can&amp;rsquo;t do the same the other way around.</description>

      <title>Automatically create local home directory when logging in with FreeIPA</title>

      <description>Intro While setting up my hosts with FreeIPA, I noticed that home directories were not being created when logging in through ssh. Looking online it seems that most people just use NFS shares to keep home directories the same across devices but I did not want to set up NFS home shares. Fixing this in RHEL-based distros is easy with authconfig but debian-based distros do not come with this. To fix this in debian-based distros is as easy as modiyfing the pam.</description>
